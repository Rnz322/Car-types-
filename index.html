  <section id="hatchback">
    <h2><span class="material-icons">directions_car_filled</span>Hatchback</h2>
    <p>One of the most popular types of car in the UK is the hatchback. They’re pretty small, economical, and they do pretty much everything you need them to do with not much space to do it.</p>
    <p>These are things like your Fiestas, A1-2s, even A Classes and Focuses. The benefits come from using them in traffic. They save fuel, are great for city life, and are cheaper too.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="saloon">
    <h2><span class="material-icons">time_to_leave</span>Saloon</h2>
    <p>Saloon cars are often slightly larger engine types with a different shape. Think Insignias, Mondeos, A4s, Lexus, Maserati, Mercedes, BMWs, etc.</p>
    <p>They’re fast, reliable, and comfortable—available in budget and luxury ranges.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="estate">
    <h2><span class="material-icons">airport_shuttle</span>Estate</h2>
    <p>Estate cars are practical and often underrated. They usually originate from modified saloon or sports cars, extended for van-like practicality while keeping comfort and performance.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="suv">
    <h2><span class="material-icons">suv</span>SUV</h2>
    <p>An SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) is a utility vehicle with a sporty edge. Large, fast, and powerful—though not always affordable.</p>
    <p>Models include Skoda Sportif, Range Rovers, and BMW X6s. They combine performance with size.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="4x4">
    <h2><span class="material-icons">offroad</span>4×4</h2>
    <p>4×4s are built for off-road use and sheer practicality. Perfect for farms and harsh terrains. Think Land Rovers and tough work vehicles.</p>
    <p>Great for those needing durability and power with an optional sporty upgrade.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="people">
    <h2><span class="material-icons">groups</span>People Carrier</h2>
    <p>People carriers are designed to transport more passengers without sacrificing safety. They’re not the fastest or sleekest but get the job done with larger engines.</p>
    <p>Ideal for large families or regular car-sharing.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="sports">
    <h2><span class="material-icons">speed</span>Sports</h2>
    <p>Sports cars are dream machines, built for speed and acceleration, not practicality. They’re expensive and consume a lot of fuel—but they are incredibly fun.</p>
    <p>They're not large or always comfortable, but they move fast—and that’s the point.</p>
